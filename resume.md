Hi, my name is Marc Dominik Migge. I'm a software engineer from Cologne, Germany.

I hold a degree in computer science from the University of Bonn.

For most of my career I have been developing web applications. I do full stack work, but my focus is on the backend. I started out with PHP and later switched to Node and Ruby. What fascinates me most about web development is the distributed systems aspect of larger scale applications.

Privately, I like to explore other areas of programming (see [projects](/projects/)). My favorite language for this is Rust and I hope to use it professionally in the future.

As hobby, I have been playing [Go][1] since 2004 and that in turn lead me to start studying Japanese. I passed the N3 level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test in 2016.
