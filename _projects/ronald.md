Having written a few simple virtual machines this is my first emulator of an actual system that
exists in hardware. I choose to emulate the [Amstrad CPC][1] because it was the first computer I
owned, and its built-in BASIC interpreter got me started with programming. The emulation still
has some issues, but it's able to run a few games - even with audio.
